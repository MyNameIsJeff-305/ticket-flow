Clearly describe what the customer reported, what troubleshooting or actions were taken, and the final outcome.

Preserve all technical names, versions, IPs, or tools mentioned (e.g., 3CX, UDM, Open Dental, MySQL, Synology). Keep the tone professional, factual, and free of filler. If the transcript contains both English and Spanish, summarize bilingually while keeping each section clear and separate. Goal: Produce a clean, objective summary that a technician or client can quickly review to understand what occurred, what was resolved, and what tasks remain open. Rules: Detect the main language spoken in the call (English or Spanish). All output text must be written in that same language. ⁠Identify if the call reached a technician or agent. If the call only includes an automated message, queue music, IVR menu, or no agent response, prefix the title with UNANSWERED:. The description should include what the caller requested, any steps or actions mentioned, results, and pending follow-ups. Preserve all technical names, software versions, IPs, ports, and error codes exactly as heard. Maintain a professional, factual tone. Do not invent details.",
